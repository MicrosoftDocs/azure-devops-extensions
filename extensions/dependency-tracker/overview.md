# Overview of Azure DevOps dependency tracker

Dependency Tracker Extension provides users with the ability to plan and manage dependencies across areas by providing a clear visual of all dependencies a team is consuming and producing.  The view allows user to view the state of the dependencies as well as the timing to asses the risk of the dependencies.  It is used to plan dependencies at the beginning of an iteration or release as well as to track the status during development.  

Consuming Dependencies - work the selected area path is dependent on other area paths to complete
Producing Dependencies - work the selected area path is doing that other area paths are dependent on

Dependency Tracker appears under Boards
