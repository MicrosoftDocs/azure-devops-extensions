# Dependency Timeline

The Dependency Timeline feature is in Beta.  The Timeline is designed to provide clear sequencing of dependencies across months.

## Features

- Red arrows highlight when the sequencing is out of order and a predecessor is scheduled to be complete after a successor
- The left-hand colored bar designates the state of each item
- Hover over an item to see a detailed card or double click to open an individual work item
- Right clicking of an item to reassign it to a new iteration

In order for the timeline to function correctly Iterations must have dates assigned
